Currently I mocked submitting request to your server because I have an problem (Can you enable
CORS on your server? and allow requests from localhost:3000 or from anywhere? because even in no-cors mode there is a problem with CORB).

1. Describe possible optimizations for your code.
  - Rewrite this app without redux (I used it just to show that I know how to work with it)
  - Use typescript (I didn't use it because task says 'Please use the following technologies:
    JS, Git, SCSS any third party library and framework can be used')
  - remove redux-logger from production build
2. Which things could be done better, than youâ€™ve done it?
  - Add some polyfill for fetch
  - Make own wrapper above input component
  - Add from validation
  - Add unit tests
  - Add favicon
  - Build own location autocomplete component
